Developing electron app that allows one to watch all the videos in a folder and keep or
discard them. 

Co-written with ChatGPT-4 as an experiment.

The code has currently been generated by a series of conversational prompts to
ChatGPT using the gpt-4 model. I've edited the code as i would following a
series of blog posts, or an interactive class, asking the tool to change aspects of the program, adding
features or correcting misapprehensions. I have not written or modified any code
by hand.

So far the code works each time, unlike gpt-3.5. I don't know enough about
electron (this is my first work with the framework) to know if the code is any
good but even i can tell that the code doesn't check its inputs or check for
errors, much less handle them, but we haven't discussed those aspects yet. It's
fragile code, like you'd expect from a blog post.

I haven't tried generating tests for this code.

This version is good enough to use as I sift through my trailcam videos so I'm
saving a version here.

# Can you license plagiarism?

I don't know much about law, but it seems silly to try and claim ownership of
this code and thus license it. So this code has no author (just a coach) and no license.
